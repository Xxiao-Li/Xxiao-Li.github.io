I possess expertise in the interdisciplinary field of empirical ecology and mathematical modelling.

My research extends across both the empirical food web establishment consisting of many different types of organisms in coastal ecosystems, and the utilization of mathematically dynamical models to solve ecological responses.

Currentlyï¼ŒI am joining Beckerman's lab working on the UKRI project "Assessing and Managing the Impacts of Mixtures of Chemicals on UK Freshwater Biodiversity in a Changing World", In particular, I focus on investigating multiple-stressor impacts on food web dynamics and functioning.
