I am interested in the interdisciplinary field of empirical ecology and mathematical modeling. I am joining the UKRI project "Assessing and Managing the Impacts of Mixtures of Chemicals on UK Freshwater Biodiversity in a Changing World", In particular, I focus on investigating multiple-stressor impacts on food web dynamics and functioning.
